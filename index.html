      <h2 class="m">Who is me ?</h2>
      <p class="m">
        I am Quinlan Lamar as a Jedi or Nullityus as a Sith. As a Jedi, I am a Jedi knight, though I have no rank as a Sith.
      </p>
      <h2 class="m">What is the Force ?</h2>
      <p class="m">
        By my definition, the universe, God and the Force are the same thing. The universe is God and everything exists in it and it is everything and it surrounds everything, it creates us, it creates the planets and it holds everything together. We are little pieces of God. So we are part of the universe. There was a big bang, and atoms and stars formed and moved forward to the present time. Each one of us is just a little piece of them.
      </p>
      <p class="m">
        It is us living beings that make God conscious. The living force is the most sacred thing in the universe. As life evolves, it tries to define the universe. God understands himself better. 
      </p>
      <p class="m">
        We were once God and we will return to him. Death has a meaning, it causes us to leave our mission, which is a small part of God is consciousness, and become God himself. Life is precious and especially the level of intelligence is important. The more it develops, the more the consciousness of God increases.
      </p>
      <p class="m">
        You have a connection with the table in front of you, the technological device in your hand. We are all more connected than we realize. We are all one and we make up one thing, the universe. This brings harmony. When you argue with someone, think about it and argue in harmony.       
      </p>
      <h2 class="m">What ?? Jedi and Sith. What is Happening in Here</h2>
      <p class="m">
        Jedi and sith are not enemies in real life. They are just two ways of thinking with two different philosophical perspectives. On a very basic level, this is my conceptualization of the Sith path, but rather than being external (like your examples of technology etc.) it is entirely internal.
      </p>
      <p class="m">
        Not everything I do is for myself, because most of the time I do things for others, like friends and family, but what I do in my own time is accounted for. Since this is the only life I have, I try not to waste it. 
      </p>
      <p class="m">
        In addition, a big part of the Sith path is integrating the ugly parts of your Self into the whole. We do not ignore the dark, shadowy parts of our emotions and thoughts. Rather, we accept and embrace them. Knowing what we are capable of makes it much easier to understand ourselves and the world.
        Jedi take a different approach. They choose to push these thoughts and feelings out in favor of healthier ones. Which is equally valuable.
        The important thing is that whatever the path, it must always remain within healthy boundaries. All paths can have overzealous followers.
      </p>
      <p class="m">    
        I think the Force is more than light and dark, there is not just black and white. I am both sith and Jedi and balanced. 
      </p>
      <p class="m">
        Today is jedis are too dogmatic and adopt it as a religion. The Jedi path is already open to dogmas and we should stay away from dogmas. Today is sith are too much fictionalized gothic and full of mental illness.
      </p>
      <h2 class="m"> What Do You Think The Jedi Are</h2>
      <p class="m">
        Does the Jedi ignore the darkness, underestimate it and focus only on the rosy light, or does accept the darkness and use it only when necessary?
      </p>
      <p class="m">
        Must a Jedi always oppose the darkness? Should not this be used in a way that does not conflict with one is own Jedi ethics? Of course, control must be on the light side for the Jedi. So in the fictional universe, Luke is order was between the gray Jedi and the dogmatic jedi, who only used darkness when necessary.
      </p>
      <p class="m">
        Power is power everywhere. Under the control of the light, the dark side is the path to reach your own true potential.
      </p>
      <p class="m">
        My thoughts are the same as Luke is pattern . A Jedi must use the dark side in moderation and be under the control of the light.
